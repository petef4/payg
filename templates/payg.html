    <p id="discount">
      <span class="bigger">Discounts</span> are often available when
      committing to some usage (aka add-ons or bolt-ons). Many plans give free
      credits when a top-up is made but these tend to be valid for 30 days
      only. Extra services are available, some of which are free. Follow the
      links for individual plans to find out more. Some of the better hidden
      fine print can be found in the
      <span class="fine-print">plan details</span> links of the operators
      column.
    </p>
    <p id="landline">
      <span class="bigger">01, 02 and 03</span> prefixed numbers are billed as
      landlines. Although 03 does not correspond to a geographic area it is
      guaranteed to be charged the same as 01 and 02.
    </p>
    <p id="mobile">
      <span class="bigger">Numbers starting 07</span> are mostly UK mobile and
      will be charged at the rate shown in the same or other column depending on
      whether the number shares your operator. There is no way of knowing that
      as the 5 digit prefix only indicates the original operator. Many numbers
      have been ported to different operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      070 and 076 numbers are for personal numbers and pagers. They attract
      higher charges for PAYG customers and are not included in contracts or
      bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more complicated exceptions. More than 40 prefixes are for
      Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man; they are not part of the United
      Kingdom. Again they cost more from PAYG and are excluded from contracts.
      There may be other exceptions for niche services. The exceptions are not
      standard, you have to look in the fine print of each operator to see
      exactly which prefixes are excluded.
    <p id="nongeo">
      <span class="bigger">Non-geographic numbers</span> are now regulated by
      Ofcom. Numbers starting 0800, 0808 and 116 are free from mobiles, as they
      always have been from landlines. For numbers starting 084, 087, 09 and 118
      there is a cleaner charge structure. Calls to them have an access charge
      plus a service charge. The access charge is set by the mobile operator and
      is listed here in the 08x column. The service charge is set by the company
      you are calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you call a 118 number from EE, the access charge is 44p
      per minute and the service charge is up to £2.43 per minute. So if your
      call is less than a minute it may cost £2.87. Ofcom introduced price caps
      in 2019-04, it used to be even more expensive.
    </p>
    <p id="mno">
      <span class="bigger">The four main networks</span> are EE, O2, Vodafone
      and 3. EE also runs the Orange and T-Mobile brands for old accounts. 3 and
      EE have a joint venture <a href="http://www.mbnl.co.uk/">MBNL</a> to
      combine their 3G networks. O2 and Vodafone have their own joint venture
      called Cornerstone (Beacon Programme) to share masts. This should lead to
      two coverage maps to consider rather than four or five. BT have taken over
      EE. 3 tried to merge with O2 but the regulators did not approve. O2
      stopped offering PAYG on 2019-11-07.
    </p>
    <p id="mvno">
      <span class="bigger">MVNOs</span> are operators who do not run their own
      network. The ones who target UK usage are 1pMobile, Asda, Call&amp;Give,
      co-operative mobile, giffgaff, iD Mobile, RWG and Tesco. Those geared
      towards international plans include AfriMobile, CMLink, CTExcel, Lebara,
      Lycamobile, NordTelekom, Now Mobile, Talk Home, Telfoni, Vectone and
      White Mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auracall, GO-SIM, MAXROAM, Pebble and Truphone pitch themselves as roaming
      MVNOs. It is not possible to port numbers in and out, except for Pebble.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are {{ counts.operator }} operators listed here offering {{
      counts.plan }} PAYG plans. <a href="http://www.mvnodynamics.com/">MVNO
      Dynamics</a> (formerly Prepaid MVNO) reported that there were 92 MVNOs as of
      May 2013, and
      <a href="http://www.telecompaper.com/research/mvno-list/united-kingdom">Telecompaper</a>
      listed 54, though not all offer PAYG.
    </p>
    <p id="coverage">
      <span class="bigger">Coverage maps</span> are available on the main
      network sites:
      <a href="https://coverage.ee.co.uk/coverage/ee">EE</a>,
      <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker">O2</a>,
      <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/network/status-checker">Vodafone</a>,
      <a href="https://www.three.co.uk/support/coverage">3</a>.
      <a href="https://checker.ofcom.org.uk/en-gb/mobile-coverage">Ofcom</a> and
      <a href="https://www.gsma.com/coverage/">GSMA</a>
      have coverage maps for most of the 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G networks. Several
      MVNOs do not provide access to 4G. 5G is being rolled out but only ASDA
      offer it on PAYG.
    </p>
    <p id="bonus">
      <span class="bigger">Free credit</span> is given by many plans on each
      top-up. It generally lasts for 30 days, though often restricted to their
      own numbers. The footnotes show exceptions. Best is Tesco which
      offers triple credit. Tesco has a minimum top-up of £10 and the bonus
      credit expires after 1 month.
    </p>
    <p id="minimum">
      <span class="bigger">Minimum call charges</span> are generally one minute.
      The exception is Co-op who have no minimum charge and time by one second
      intervals. After the first minute some operators round up call lengths to
      the next full minute and others charge by the second. The former
      effectively have higher charges than at first glance. See the Bill Per
      column.
    </p>
    <p id="inactivity">
      <span class="bigger">Inactivity</span> will cause your account to be
      terminated and unused credit lost. To avoid that you must make a
      chargeable call, text or data access, or top up within a period set out
      in the terms and conditions. That period is usually 180 days. Exceptions
      include White (60 days), ASDA, Lebara &amp; Lycamobile (90 days) and
      1pMobile &amp; iD (120 days). 1pMobile require that you top up (minimum
      £10) every 120 days but that credit does not expire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular credit is never lost if the activity criteria are met, except for
      <span class="poor">Vectone whose call credits expire after 90 days</span>
      and iD whose credits expire after 365 days. (Other
      operators’ <a href="#bonus">free or bonus credit</a> tends to expire after
      30 days but their top-ups last indefinitely, subject to inactivity.)
    </p>
    <p id="tether">
      <span class="bigger">Tethering</span> (aka hotspots) is using your phone
      to provide mobile internet access to other devices such as laptops. Not
      all operators allow this.
    </p>
    <p id="defunct">
      <span class="bigger">Defunct</span> operators or those that no longer

    <p id="voip">
      <span class="bigger">VoIP</span> can offer a similar service to mobile
      phones but it does so using mobile data or Wi-Fi. It is not a completely
      seamless replacement. Wi-Fi calling allows calls and texts to be sent and
      received when reception is poor but they are still paid for at the
      standard rates. VoIP tends to be free. Wi-Fi calling support depends on
      the operator and the phone model.
