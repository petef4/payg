    <p>
      These are the rates for true pay as you go tariffs only. Some other plans
      are labelled PAYG but require monthly top-ups, etc. Plans which are not
      open to new customers are also excluded. So Orange and T-Mobile are no
      longer listed as EE is the only brand available.

    <p>
      <span class="bigger">Discounts</span> are often available when
      committing to some usage (aka add-ons or bolt-ons). Many plans give free
      credits when a top-up is made but these tend to be valid for 30 days
      only. Extra services are available, some of which are free. Follow the
      links for individual plans to find out more. Some of the better hidden
      fine print can be found in the
      <span class="fine-print">plan details</span> links of the operators
      column.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">Non-geographic numbers</span> are now regulated by
      Ofcom. Numbers starting 0800, 0808 and 116 are free from mobiles, as they
      always have been from landlines. For numbers starting 084, 087, 09 and 118
      there is a cleaner charge structure. Calls to them have an access charge
      plus a service charge. The access charge is set by the mobile operator and
      is listed here in the 08x column. The service charge is set by the company
      you are calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you call 118 118 from EE, the access charge is 44p per
      minute and the service charge is £2.75 per call plus £2.99 per minute. So
      if your call is less than a minute it will cost £6.18.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">The four main networks</span> are EE, O2, Vodafone
      and 3. EE also runs the Orange and T-Mobile brands for old accounts. 3 and
      EE have a joint venture <a href="http://www.mbnl.co.uk/">MBNL</a> to
      combine their 3G networks. O2 and Vodafone have their own joint venture
      called Cornerstone to share masts. This should lead to two coverage maps
      to consider rather than four or five. BT are taking over EE and 3 is
      merging with O2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">MVNOs</span> are operators who do not run their own
      network. The ones who target UK usage are allpay Mobile, Asda,
      Call&amp;Give, co-operative mobile, Delight Mobile, giffgaff, Mobile by
      The People’s Operator, Post Office Mobile, Talkmobile, talkxtra, Tello,
      Tesco and Virgin Mobile. Those geared towards international plans include
      AfriMobile, CTExcelbiz, Econet, Globe UK, GT Mobile, Jadoo, Kingdom
      mobile, Kontakt, Lebara, Lomo Mobile, Lycamobile, Now Mobile, SMART UK,
      Talk Home, Vectone and White Mobile. Aether, Auracall, GO-SIM, Maxroam,
      Pebble, toggle and Truphone are pitching themselves as roaming
      MVNOs. <a href="http://www.mvnodynamics.com/">MVNO Dynamics</a> (formerly
      Prepaid MVNO) reports that there are 92 MVNOs as of May 2013, and
      <a href="http://www.telecompaper.com/research/mvno-list/united-kingdom">Telecompaper</a>
      lists 54, though not all offer PAYG.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 40 operators listed here offering 44 PAYG plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">Coverage maps</span> are linked to in the Network
      column. The
      <a href="http://maps.mobileworldlive.com/network.php?cid=39&amp;cname=United%20Kingdom">GSMA</a>
      have coverage maps for most of the 2G, 3G and 4G networks. It is unclear
      whether EE’s Smart Signal Sharing applies to all its MVNOs yet. Several
      operators charge a premium for 4G.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">Free credit</span> is given by many plans on each
      top-up. It generally lasts for 30 days, though often restricted to their
      own numbers. The footnotes show exceptions. Best is
      Kontakt<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Next best is Tesco which
      offers triple credit. Tesco has a minimum top-up of £10 and the bonus
      credit expires after 1 month.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bigger">Minimum call charges</span> are generally one minute.
      The exceptions are Co-op and Virgin who have no minimum charge and time by
      one second intervals. After the first minute some operators round up call
      lengths to the next full minute and others charge by the second. The
      former effectively have higher charges than at first glance. See the Bill
      Per column.
